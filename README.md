Circle.ai App

This repository contains a React application built using Vite and integrated with the Gemini API for fetching data. Below are the instructions for setting up and running the project.

Setup Instructions:
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-clone-react-app.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd ai-clone-react-app
Install dependencies using npm:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Create a config folder if not already present, and add a gemini.js file inside it. In gemini.js, configure your Gemini API credentials. Below is an example of how the gemini.js file should be structured:
javascript
Copy code
// config/gemini.js

const geminiConfig = {
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  apiSecret: 'your-api-secret'
};

module.exports = geminiConfig;
Replace 'your-api-key' and 'your-api-secret' with your actual Gemini API credentials.

Once the dependencies are installed and the Gemini API is configured, you can start the development server using the following command:
bash
Copy code
npm run dev
This will start the development server, and you should be able to access the application at http://localhost:3000.

Additional Notes:
Make sure to keep your Gemini API credentials secure and do not expose them publicly.
For production deployment, you may need to adjust the configuration accordingly.
Feel free to explore and modify the application code based on your requirements.
If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us. Happy coding!
